SmallDuty is a New Zealand IT company pays its employees on a weekly basis. The employees are categorised in four categories: 
•	Salaried employees are paid a fixed weekly salary regardless of the number of hours worked, 
•	Hourly paid employees are paid by the hour and receive overtime pay (i.e., 1.5 times their hourly salary rate) for all hours worked more than 40 hours,
•	Commission only employees are paid a percentage of their sales and 
•	Base-salaried commission employees receive a base salary plus a percentage of their sales. 

For the current pay period, the company has decided to reward salaried-commission employees by adding 10% to their base salaries. The company wants you to write an application that performs its payroll calculations polymorphically.
